# Quality Wordle Solver

## Features
* **Information Theory Engine:** Uses Shannon Entropy to find the mathematically optimal guesses.
* **Advanced Endgame:** Switches to Minimax logic when <20 words remain to prevent traps.
* **Multithreading**

## How to Run
1. Download the latest `.exe` from the **Releases** tab.
3. Press letter boxes to update color.
4. 'Calculate'.  Press 'Reset' at any time to wipe memory and start from scratch.

## Notes
* Solver assumes first word guessed is 'SLATE'.
* If a non-generated word is used, boxes can be edited manually.
* Solver does not contain *actual* potential answers, as they are manually selected from a private source.  Errors will sometimes occur as a result of using an outdated word bank.
